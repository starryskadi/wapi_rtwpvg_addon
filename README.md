# WP ALL IMPORT + [Variation Images Gallery for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-product-variation-gallery/)

This plugin enables the import of variation images using WP ALL IMPORT.

Currently, it is tested only with the `Update Existing Items` process and does not support the `Create New Item` process yet.

In the `Variation Images Gallery Settings`, you can choose whether to replace existing images.

Under `Variation Image Gallery Images`, you can input the images.

To insert existing images, ensure you enable at least the following options:

- [x] Update existing WooCommerce products with the data in this import file
- [x] Choose which data to update
- [x] Custom Fields - Update only Images
